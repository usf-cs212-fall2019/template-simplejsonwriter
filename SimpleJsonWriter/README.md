Simple JSON Writer
=================================================

For this homework assignment, you will create a class that outputs various collections as "pretty" JSON objects or arrays to file. Use the `\t` tab character for indentation, and use line separators between elements. For example, a "pretty" JSON array looks like:

```
[
	1,
	2,
	3
]
```

Note that there is no comma after the last element in the array. Objects look like:

```
{
	"one": 1,
	"two": 2,
	"three": 3
}
```

Note that strings and keys are always in `"` quotation marks, but numbers are not. A nested object looks like:

```
{
	"one": [
		1
	],
	"two": [
		1,
		2
	],
	"three": [
		1,
		2,
		3
	]
}
```

Use `UTF8` when writing your files. See the Javadoc comments in the template code for additional details.

## Requirements ##

The official name of this homework is `SimpleJsonWriter`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project and the name you use when running the homework test script.

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs212-fall2019.github.io/guides/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- Eclipse has built-in file comparison functionality. It can show you exactly how your file output differs from the expected output (even if its just a trailing space at the end of a line).

- If you directly call `write()` an `int` or `Integer`, it will often be seen as a character code. For example, `65` is the character code for `A`. If you want to actually write the digits `65` to file, convert to a `String` object first. For example, try running this:
  ```
  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out);
  Integer i = 65;
  writer.write(i);
  writer.flush();
  ```
  
  Compare that output to:
  ```
  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out);
  Integer i = 65;
  writer.write(i.toString());
  writer.flush();
  ```
  
  Note this is not a problem for most `print()` and `println()` methods, so it depends on what you use to write to file.

- The [official JSON documentation](http://www.json.org/) can be a little difficult to parse. There [are](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) [other](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JSON/article.html) [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+examples) out there.

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
